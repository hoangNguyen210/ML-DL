# MACHINE LEARNING  AND DEEP LEARNING 
This is 2 course about Machine Learning and Deep Learning that I learnt at my university.




## Machine Learning

In this course, I learnt to implement some Machine Learning to solve Regression and mainly Classification task.

## Deep Learning

In this course, I learnt to familar with Deep Learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.
